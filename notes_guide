1. Core Ideas
   
Scalability → How to handle more users/data:
Vertical: Upgrade the same machine (limited growth).
Horizontal: Add more machines (preferred for big systems).

Latency = How long one request takes.
Throughput = How many requests you handle per second.

Availability → How much of the time your system is up (e.g., 99.99%).
Reliability → Works correctly even if some parts fail.
Consistency → Same data everywhere at the same time.

CAP Theorem → Can only pick two: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance.
